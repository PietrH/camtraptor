camtrapdp aims to experiment and test visualization functionalities for camera trap data formatted following the [Camera Trap Data Package standard](https://github.com/tdwg/camtrap-dp). The goal of the authors is still to contribute as much as possible to improve widely used packages in the camera trap data R community, e.g. `camtrapR` and `activity`.
